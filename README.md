It's an ideal tool for automating notifications, alerts, or any kind of messages that need to be sent from various systems, servers, or personal projects. Beyond simply sending messages, this script also leverages the API's response to provide insights into the chat, making it a versatile tool for both communication and information retrieval.

## Getting Started

- A Telegram bot token, which you can obtain by creating a bot through [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram.
- The chat ID of the user, group, or channel to which you want to send messages. For private chats with the bot, you can easily obtain this by initiating a conversation with your bot and visiting https://api.telegram.org/bot<YourBOTToken>/getUpdates.

```bash
python3 TelegramMessageInsight.py
